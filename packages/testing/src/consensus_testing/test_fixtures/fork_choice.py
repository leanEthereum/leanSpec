        Build a full SignedBlockWithAttestation from a lightweight BlockSpec.

        Builds blocks via state transition dry-run, similar to state transition tests,
        but also creates a proper proposer attestation for fork choice.
        This mimics what a local block builder would do.

        TODO: We cannot use Store.produce_block_with_signatures() because it has
        side effects (adds block to store at lines 556-559 of store.py). If the spec
        is refactored to separate block production from store updates, we should use
        that method instead. Until then, this manual approach is necessary.

        ----------
        spec : BlockSpec
            The lightweight block specification.
        store : Store
