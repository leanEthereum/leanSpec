Fork Choice Head Selection (LMD-GHOST Algorithm)
=================================================

Overview
--------
Tests the core fork choice algorithm that determines which block should be
considered the canonical chain head. This implements the LMD-GHOST algorithm.

The LMD-GHOST Algorithm
-----------------------
LMD-GHOST selects the canonical head by:

1. **Start at a checkpoint**: Begin at a justified or finalized checkpoint.
2. **Walk down the tree**: At each fork, choose the child with the most weight.
3. **Weight from attestations**: Each validator's latest attestation adds weight.
4. **Tie-breaking**: When weights are equal, choose lexicographically highest hash.
5. **Walk to leaf**: Continue until reaching a leaf block (no children).

Key Concepts
------------

**Head**:
    - The canonical chain tip selected by fork choice.
    - All operations (attestation, block proposal) use this as the reference point.

**Attestation Weight**:
    - Each validator's latest attestation adds 1 unit of weight to a block
    and all its ancestors. Heavier subtrees are preferred.

**Fork Choice Rule**:
    - At each decision point: choose the child with highest weight.
    - If tied: choose the child with lexicographically highest block root.

**Latest Message**:
    - Only the most recent attestation from each validator counts.
    - Earlier attestations are superseded.

**Proposer Attestations**:
    - When a validator proposes a block, they implicitly attest to it.
    - This creates weight that influences fork choice for subsequent blocks.

    Fork choice head advances through a deep chain correctly.

    Scenario
    --------
    Build a long chain (slots 1-20) and verify head reaches the end.

    Expected Behavior:
        - Head advances through all 20 blocks

    Why This Matters
    ----------------
    This tests that the fork choice algorithm scales to longer chains and
    correctly handles the tree-walking logic through many blocks.

    Real networks have chains thousands of blocks long. The algorithm must:
    - Efficiently traverse deep trees
    - Maintain correct head even with many ancestors
    - Not degrade in performance or correctness with depth

    A 20-block chain is a modest test of this scalability.

    Scenario
    --------
    Build blocks at slots 1, 3, 5, 7, 9 (skipping even slots).

    Expected Behavior:

    Why This Matters
    ----------------
    Missed slots are common in production:
    - Offline proposers
    - Network partitions
    - Proposer failures

    Fork choice must handle sparse block production correctly. The algorithm
    doesn't require consecutive slots - it works with any tree structure where
    gaps are simply missing nodes.

    This verifies the algorithm handles real-world conditions where not every
    slot has a block, which is the norm rather than the exception.

    Fork choice head switches when a competing fork becomes heavier.

    Expected Behavior:

    Why This Matters
    ----------------
    This demonstrates the core LMD-GHOST property: the head follows the heaviest
    subtree. When fork B is extended with a child block, that child's proposer
    implicitly attests to fork B, giving it more weight.

    Fork choice recognizes this weight increase and switches the head to fork B's
    descendant. This is how the protocol reaches consensus - validators converge
    on the fork with the most support (weight).

    This is also how reorgs happen: a previously non-canonical fork can become
    canonical if it gains more attestation weight.
