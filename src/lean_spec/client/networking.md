  SECONDS_PER_SLOT * SLOTS_PER_EPOCH * 2

#### Topics and messages

Topics are plain UTF-8 strings and are encoded on the wire as determined by
protobuf (gossipsub messages are enveloped in protobuf messages). Topic strings
have form: `/leanconsensus/devnet0/Name/Encoding`. This defines both the type of
data being sent on the topic and how the data field of the message is encoded.

- `Name` - see table below
- `Encoding` - the encoding strategy describes a specific representation of
  bytes that will be transmitted over the wire. See the [Encodings](#Encodings)
  section for further details.

The optional `from` (1), `seqno` (3), `signature` (5) and `key` (6) protobuf
fields are omitted from the message, since messages are identified by content,
anonymous, and signed where necessary in the application layer.

The `message-id` of a gossipsub message MUST be the following 20 byte value
computed from the message data:

- If `message.data` has a valid snappy decompression, set `message-id` to the
  first 20 bytes of the `SHA256` hash of the concatenation of
  `MESSAGE_DOMAIN_VALID_SNAPPY` with the snappy decompressed message data, i.e.
  `SHA256(MESSAGE_DOMAIN_VALID_SNAPPY + snappy_decompress(message.data))[:20]`.
- Otherwise, set `message-id` to the first 20 bytes of the `SHA256` hash of the
  concatenation of `MESSAGE_DOMAIN_INVALID_SNAPPY` with the raw message data,
  i.e. `SHA256(MESSAGE_DOMAIN_INVALID_SNAPPY + message.data)[:20]`.

Where relevant, clients MUST reject messages with `message-id` sizes other than
20 bytes.

*Note*: The above logic handles two exceptional cases: (1) multiple snappy
`data` can decompress to the same value, and (2) some message `data` can fail to
snappy decompress altogether.

The payload is carried in the `data` field of a gossipsub message, and varies
depending on the topic:

| Name                             | Message Type              |
| -------------------------------- | ------------------------- |
| `lean_block`                     | `Block`                   |
| `lean_attestation`               | `Attestation`             |

Clients MUST reject (fail validation) messages containing an incorrect type, or
invalid payload.

#### Encodings

Topics are post-fixed with an encoding. Encodings define how the payload of a
gossipsub message is encoded.

- `ssz_snappy` - All objects are SSZ-encoded and then compressed with
  [Snappy](https://github.com/google/snappy) block compression. Example: The
  beacon aggregate attestation topic string is
  `/eth2/446a7232/beacon_aggregate_and_proof/ssz_snappy`, the fork digest is
  `446a7232` and the data field of a gossipsub message is an `AggregateAndProof`
  that has been SSZ-encoded and then compressed with Snappy.

Snappy has two formats: "block" and "frames" (streaming). Gossip messages remain
relatively small (100s of bytes to 100s of kilobytes) so
[basic snappy block compression](https://github.com/google/snappy/blob/master/format_description.txt)
is used to avoid the additional overhead associated with snappy frames.

Implementations MUST use a single encoding for gossip. Changing an encoding will
require coordination between participating implementations.

### The Req/Resp domain

#### Protocol identification

Each message type is segregated into its own libp2p protocol ID, which is a
case-sensitive UTF-8 string of the form:

```
/leanconsensus/req/MessageName/SchemaVersion/Encoding
```

With:

- `MessageName` - each request is identified by a name consisting of English
  alphabet, digits and underscores (`_`).
- `SchemaVersion` - an ordinal version number (e.g. 1, 2, 3â€¦). Each schema is
  versioned to facilitate backward and forward-compatibility when possible.
- `Encoding` - while the schema defines the data types in more abstract terms,
  the encoding strategy describes a specific representation of bytes that will
  be transmitted over the wire. See the [Encodings](#Encoding-strategies)
  section for further details.

This protocol segregation allows libp2p `multistream-select 1.0` to handle the
request type, version, and encoding negotiation before establishing the
underlying streams.

#### Encoding strategies

The token of the negotiated protocol ID specifies the type of encoding to be
used for the req/resp interaction. Only one value is possible at this time:

- `ssz_snappy`: The contents are first
  [SSZ-encoded](../../ssz/simple-serialize.md) and then compressed with
  [Snappy](https://github.com/google/snappy) frames compression. For objects
  containing a single field, only the field is SSZ-encoded not a container with
  a single field. For example, the `LeanBlocksByRoot` request is an
  SSZ-encoded list of `Root`'s. This encoding type MUST be supported by all
  clients.

#### Messages

##### LeanBlocksByRoot v1

**Protocol ID:** `/leanconsensus/req/lean_blocks_by_root/1/`

Request Content:

```
(
  List[Root, MAX_REQUEST_BLOCKS]
)
```

Response Content:

```
(
  List[SignedLeanBlock, MAX_REQUEST_BLOCKS]
)
```

Requests blocks by block root (= `hash_tree_root(SignedLeanBlock.message)`).
The response is a list of `SignedLeanBlock` whose length is less than or equal
to the number of requested blocks. It may be less in the case that the
responding peer is missing blocks.

`LeanBlocksByRoot` is primarily used to recover recent blocks (e.g. when
receiving a block or attestation whose parent is unknown).

The request MUST be encoded as an SSZ-field.

The response MUST consist of zero or more `response_chunk`. Each _successful_
`response_chunk` MUST contain a single `SignedLeanBlock` payload.

Clients MUST respond with at least one block, if they have it. Clients MAY limit
the number of blocks in the response.
