          - `justifications_roots`: The list of block roots under consideration.

            the boolean votes for all roots.

        This method efficiently de-flattens this data into a more intuitive
        dictionary, mapping each root to its corresponding list of validator

        Example:
            If `justifications_roots` = `[root_A, root_B]` and the validator
            limit is 4, `justifications_validators` would be a single list

        Overview
        --------
        This method consumes a block's attestations and updates three parts of the state:
          1) The in-progress per-target vote tracker (the "justifications" map),
          2) The latest justified checkpoint,
          3) The latest finalized checkpoint.

        Votes are only counted if they satisfy the following invariants:
          - The vote's source slot is already justified.
          - The target slot is not already justified.
          - The vote's source root matches history at its slot.
          - The vote's target root matches history at its slot, or (if target is the latest header)
            it matches the latest header root.
          - The target slot is strictly after the source slot.
          - The target slot is a justifiable slot with respect to the current finalized slot.

        When a target gathers a 2/3 supermajority (using exact arithmetic: 3 * count >= 2 * N),
        that target becomes justified, the corresponding per-target votes are discarded,
        and the source may become finalized if there exists no other justifiable slot strictly
        between the source and the target.
