"""
Staker Container

Lean Consensus participants are part of a unified pool of stakers,
as described in this [3TS design proposal](
https://ethresear.ch/t/three-tier-staking-3ts-unbundling-attesters-includers
-and-execution-proposers/21648/1).

Each slot, the **Staker** chooses from three different available roles:
- Attester
- Includer
- (Execution) Proposer

Each staker explicitly opts into the role(s) that they wish to take as
protocol participants.
One, two, or all three roles can be chosen, based on the stakers preferences
and level of sophistication.
Mixing and matching multiple roles is possible, under certain constraints.

Each role can be delegated to a target staker and each role can be set as
delegatable for other stakers to execute as operators.
The staker can update the staking configuration at any time.
