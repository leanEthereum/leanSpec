"""
Implements the sparse Merkle tree used in the Generalized XMSS scheme.

This module provides the data structures and algorithms for building a Merkle
tree over a contiguous subset of leaves, computing authentication paths, and
verifying those paths.

The key features are:
1.  **Sparsity**: The tree can represent a massive address space (e.g., 2^32
    leaves) while only storing the nodes relevant to a smaller, active range of
    leaves (e.g., 2^20 leaves).
2.  **Random Padding**: To simplify the logic for pairing sibling nodes, the
    active layers are padded with random hash values to ensure they always
    start at an even index and end at an odd index.
