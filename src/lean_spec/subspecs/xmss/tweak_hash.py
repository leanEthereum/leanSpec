"""
Defines the Tweakable Hash function using Poseidon2.

### The Problem: Hash Function Overload

In a complex cryptographic scheme like XMSS, a single hash function (like Poseidon2)
is used for many different purposes:
1.  Hashing iteratively to form **hash chains**.
2.  Hashing pairs of nodes to build the **Merkle tree**.
3.  Hashing the one-time public key to form a **Merkle leaf**.

If we simply called `hash(data)` for all these cases, we could run into a critical
security issue: a "collision" between different contexts. For example, the output of a
hash in a chain might accidentally be identical to the hash of two nodes in the tree.
This could allow an attacker to create forgeries.

### The Solution: Tweakable Hashing

A **tweakable hash function** solves this by treating each hash computation as having a
unique "address" or "tweak".

The function's signature becomes `hash(tweak, data)`. By ensuring every tweak is
unique across the entire scheme, we guarantee that every hash computation is
**domain-separated**, eliminating the risk of cross-context collisions.

        Encodes a structured tweak object into a list of field elements.

        It converts a high-level tweak context (like "Merkle tree, level 5, index 3")
        into a low-level format that can be consumed by the Poseidon2 hash function.

        ### Encoding Algorithm

        1.  **Packing**: The integer components of the tweak are packed into a
            single, large integer using bit-shifting. A unique prefix
            (`TWEAK_PREFIX_TREE` or `TWEAK_PREFIX_CHAIN`) is included to
            guarantee that `TreeTweak` and `ChainTweak` can never produce
            the same integer. This process is injective (one-to-one).

        2.  **Decomposition**: The resulting large integer is then decomposed into a
            list of base-`P` digits, where `P` is the field prime. This produces the
            final list of field elements.

        Args:
