        Generates a new cryptographic key pair for a specified range of epochs.

        This is a **randomized** algorithm that establishes a signer's identity.
        The generated secret key is stateful and tied to the progression of epochs.

        ### Key Generation Algorithm

        1.  **Master Secrets**: A master secret (the PRF key) and a public hash
            parameter (`P`) are randomly generated. The PRF key allows for the
            deterministic derivation of one-time secrets for each epoch.

        2.  **Hash Chains**: For each epoch in the key's active lifetime, the algorithm
            derives the secret starting points for all `DIMENSION` hash chains using the PRF.
            It then computes the public endpoint of each chain by hashing it `BASE - 1` times.

        3.  **One-Time Public Keys**: The collection of all chain endpoints for a given
            epoch constitutes that epoch's one-time public key.

        4.  **Merkle Tree Construction**: Each one-time public key is hashed to form a
            single Merkle leaf. A Merkle tree is then constructed over all the leaves
            for the active epochs. The root of this tree serves as the single, compact
            public commitment for the entire key lifetime.

        Args:
            activation_epoch: The starting epoch for which this key is valid.
            num_active_epochs: The number of consecutive epochs the key can be used for.

        Returns:
            A tuple containing the `PublicKey` and `SecretKey`.

        Produces a digital signature for a given message at a specific epoch.

        This is a **randomized** algorithm.

        **CRITICAL SECURITY WARNING**: A secret key for a given epoch must **NEVER** be used
        to sign two different messages. Doing so would reveal parts of the secret key
        and allow an attacker to forge signatures. This is the fundamental security
        property of a synchronized (stateful) signature scheme.

        ### Signing Algorithm

        1.  **Message Encoding with Randomness (`rho`)**: The "Target Sum" scheme
            requires the message hash to be encoded into a `codeword` whose digits
            sum to a predefined target. A direct hash of the message is unlikely to
            satisfy this. Therefore, the algorithm repeatedly hashes the message
            combined with fresh randomness (`rho`) until a valid `codeword` is found.

        2.  **One-Time Signature**: The `codeword` dictates how the one-time signature is
            formed. For each digit `x_i` in the codeword, the signer reveals an intermediate
            hash value by applying the hash function `x_i` times to the secret start of the
            `i`-th hash chain.
            The collection of these intermediate hashes forms the one-time signature.

        3.  **Merkle Path**: The signer retrieves the Merkle authentication path for the leaf
            corresponding to the current `epoch`. This path proves that the one-time public key
            for this epoch is part of the main public key (the Merkle root).

        Args:
            sk: The secret key to use for signing.

        This is a **deterministic** algorithm.

        ### Verification Algorithm

        1.  **Re-encode Message**: The verifier uses the randomness `rho` from the
            signature to re-compute the codeword $x = (x_1, \dots, x_v)$ from the message `m`.
            If the encoding is invalid (e.g., does not meet the target sum), verification fails.

        2.  **Reconstruct One-Time Public Key**: For each intermediate hash $y_i$ in the
            signature's `hashes` field, the verifier completes the corresponding hash chain.
            Since $y_i$ was computed by hashing $x_i$ times, the verifier applies the
            hash function an additional `BASE - 1 - x_i` times to arrive at the
            chain's public endpoint, which is one component of the one-time public key.

        3.  **Compute Merkle Leaf**: The verifier hashes the full set of reconstructed
            chain endpoints to compute the expected Merkle leaf for the given `epoch`.

        4.  **Verify Merkle Path**: The verifier uses the authentication `path` from the
            signature to compute a candidate Merkle root, starting from the leaf computed
            in the previous step. Verification succeeds if and only if this candidate root
            matches the `root` stored in the `PublicKey`.

        Args:
            pk: The public key to verify against.
            epoch: The epoch the signature corresponds to.
            message: The message that was supposedly signed.
            sig: The signature object to be verified.
