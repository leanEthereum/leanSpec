# Lean Ethereum Python Specifications

This project provides reference implementations of the Lean Ethereum protocol and its
cryptographic subspecifications.

## Specifications Overview

### Lean Ethereum Specifications

The core protocol specifications are located in `src/lean_spec/`.

### Cryptographic Subspecifications

Supporting cryptographic primitives are located in `src/lean_spec/subspecs/`.

## Design Principles

1. **Clarity over Performance**: Readable reference implementations
2. **Strong Typing**: Pydantic models with full validation
3. **Test Coverage**: Extensive tests for all modules
